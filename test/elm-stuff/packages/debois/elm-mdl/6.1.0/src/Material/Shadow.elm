{-| From the [Material Design Lite documentation](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite/blob/master/src/shadow/README.md)

> The Material Design Lite (MDL) shadow is not a component in the same sense as
> an MDL card, menu, or textbox; it is a visual effect that can be assigned to a
> user interface element. The effect simulates a three-dimensional positioning of
> the element, as though it is slightly raised above the surface it rests upon â€”
> a positive z-axis value, in user interface terms. The shadow starts at the
> edges of the element and gradually fades outward, providing a realistic 3-D
> effect.
> 
> Shadows are a convenient and intuitive means of distinguishing an element from
> its surroundings. A shadow can draw the user's eye to an object and emphasize
> the object's importance, uniqueness, or immediacy.
> 
> Shadows are a well-established feature in user interfaces, and provide users
> with a visual clue to an object's intended use or value. Their design and use
> is an important factor in the overall user experience.)
