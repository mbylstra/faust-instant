Material Design component library for Elm based on Google's
[Material Design Lite](https://www.getmdl.io/).

for a live demo. 

# Component model 

The component model of the library is simply the Elm Architecture (TEA), i.e.,
each component has types `Model` and `Msg`, and values `view` and `update`. A
minimal example using this library as plain TEA can be found
[here](https://github.com/debois/elm-mdl/blob/master/examples/Component-TEA.elm).

Using more than a few component in plain TEA is unwieldy because of the large
amount of boilerplate one has to write. This library uses the 
[Parts model](https://github.com/debois/elm-parts) for getting rid of most of
  that boilerplate. A minimal example using the parts model is
[here](http://github.com/debois/elm-mdl/blob/master/examples/Component.elm).

It is important to note that the parts model lives __within__ TEA; 
it is not an alternative architecture. 

# Getting started

The easiest way to get started is to start with one of the minimal examples above.
We recommend going with the one that uses 
[the one that uses](http://github.com/debois/elm-mdl/blob/master/examples/Component.elm)
the library's component support rather than working directly in plain Elm.

# Interfacing with CSS

This library depends on the CSS part of Google's Material Design Lite. Your app
will have to load that. See the
[Scheme](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/debois/elm-mdl/latest/Material-Scheme)
module for exposing details. (The starting point implementations above
load CSS automatically.)

# View functions

The view function of most components has this signature: 

    view : (Msg -> m) -> Model -> List (Property m) -> List (Html m) -> Html m

For technical reasons, rather than using `Html.App.map f (view ...)`, you
provide the lifting function `f` directly to the component as the first
argument. The `Model` argument is standard.  The third argument, `List (Property m)`,
is a mechanism for you to specify additional classes and CSS for the component, as well
as messages to send in response to events on the component.  You need this,
e.g., when you want to specify the width of a button. See the
[Options](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/debois/elm-mdl/latest/Material-Options)
module for details. 

Material Design defines a color palette. The 
[Color](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/debois/elm-mdl/latest/Material-Color)
module contains exposing various `Property` values and helper functions for working with
this color palette.

NB! If you are using the parts model rather than plain TEA, call `render` instead of `view`. 

# Parts model

The present module contains only convenience functions for working with nested 
components in the Elm architecture. A minimal example using this library
with component support can be found 
[here](http://github.com/debois/elm-mdl/blob/master/examples/Component.elm).
We encourage you to use the library in this fashion.

Here is how you use component support in general.  First, boilerplate. 

 1. Include `Material`:

        <!-- MDL -->
        <link href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:400,300,500|Roboto+Mono|Roboto+Condensed:400,700&subset=latin,latin-ext' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://code.getmdl.io/1.1.3/material.min.css" />

 2. Add a model container Material components to your model:

        type alias Model = 
          { ...
          , mdl : Material.Model    
          }

        model : Model = 
          { ...
          , mdl = Material.model
          }

 3. Add an action for Material components. 

        type Msg = 
          ...
          | Mdl Material.Msg 

 4. Handle that message in your update function as follows:

        update message model = 
          case message of 
            ...
            Mdl message' -> 
              Material.update Mdl message' model

You now have sufficient boilerplate for using __any__ number of elm-mdl components. 
Let's say you need a textfield for name entry, and you'd like to be notifed
whenever the field changes value through your own NameChanged action: 

        import Material.Textfield as Textfield

        ...

        type Msg = 
          ...
          | NameChanged String

        ... 

        update action model = 
          case action of 
            ...
            NameChanged name -> 
              -- Do whatever you need to do. 

        ...

        nameInput : Textfield.Instance Material.Model Msg
        nameInput = 
        
        view addr model = 
          ...
          Textfield.instance [0] Mdl model.mdl
            [ css "width" "16rem"
            , Textfield.floatingLabel
            , Textfield.onInput NameChanged
            ] 

The win relative to using plain Elm Architecture is that adding a component
neither requires you to update your model, your Msgs, nor your update function. 
(As in the above example, you will frequently have to update the latter two anyway, 
but now it's not boilerplate, its "business logic".)


## Optimising for size

Using this module will force all elm-mdl components to be built and included in 
your application. If this is unacceptable, you can custom-build a version of this
module that exposing uses only the components you need. To do so, you need to provide your
own versions of the type `Model` and the value `model` of the present module. 
Use the corresponding definitions in this module as a starting point 
([source](https://github.com/debois/elm-mdl/blob/master/src/Material.elm)) 
and simply comment out the components you do not need.
